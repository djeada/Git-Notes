## Git Tags

Tags mark *exact* commits. They‚Äôre perfect for releases, rollbacks, changelogs, and CI/CD triggers. Unlike branches, tags don‚Äôt move‚Äîever‚Äîso you can always point to the exact build you shipped.

Think of a branch as a **bookmark you keep moving**, and a tag as a **sticky note glued to a page**.

```
A -- B -- C -- D -- E  (main)
          ^ 
          |
        v1.2.0  ‚Üê frozen pointer to commit C
```

### Mental model

* A *branch* allows new features to be developed safely, while skipping branches risks breaking the main code; for example, a login feature can be built in a branch while production stays stable.
* A *tag* marks a fixed commit for easy reference, but without tags it is harder to find exact release points; for instance, version 1.0 can be recalled instantly with a tag.
* A lightweight tag gives a simple pointer to a commit, while omitting it removes a quick way to bookmark work; for example, the project‚Äôs first setup can be tagged this way.
* An annotated tag adds a message, tagger, and date, but without it, release details are lost; for example, version 2.0 can store who created the release and when.

### Creating Tags

Tags are markers you can place on commits ‚Äî often used for releases, milestones, or just to remember an important point in your project‚Äôs history. Git supports three main flavors: lightweight, annotated, and signed.

#### 1. Lightweight Tag (quick and simple)

A lightweight tag is basically a named pointer to a commit. It doesn‚Äôt store extra info (no tagger, no message).

Tag the latest commit (HEAD):

```bash
git tag v2.0.0
```

Tag a specific commit (using its short hash):

```bash
git tag v2.0.0 b4d373a
```

Check what the tag points to:

```bash
git show --no-patch v2.0.0
```

Example output:

```
tag v2.0.0
Tagger: (none - lightweight tag)
commit b4d373k8990g2...
Author: Jane Dev <jane@example.com>
Date:   Mon Sep 1 12:34:56 2025 +0000

    Merge feature: new billing flows
```

Notice how there‚Äôs no tagger or message section ‚Äî Git just jumps straight to the commit info. Lightweight tags are fine for personal bookmarks, but not recommended for formal releases.

#### 2. Annotated Tag (the usual choice for releases)

An annotated tag creates a real tag object that stores metadata: who created it, when, and an optional message.

At HEAD:

```bash
git tag -a v2.0.0 -m "v2.0.0: usage-based billing, new invoices"
```

At a specific commit:

```bash
git tag -a v2.0.0 -m "v2.0.0: ..." b4d373k
```

Inspect it:

```bash
git show v2.0.0
```

Sample output:

```
tag v2.0.0
Tagger: Jane Dev <jane@example.com>
Date:   Mon Sep 1 12:45:00 2025 +0000

v2.0.0: usage-based billing, new invoices

commit b4d373k8990g2...
Author: Jane Dev <jane@example.com>
Date:   Mon Sep 1 12:34:56 2025 +0000

    Merge feature: new billing flows
```

Here you see two parts:

* The **tag object** at the top (who created the tag, when, and why).
* The **commit** the tag points to, shown below.

This extra metadata is super handy for tracking releases and automation.

#### 3. Signed Tag (for authenticity and trust)

If you have GPG or SSH signing set up, you can cryptographically sign tags. This proves the tag really came from you.

```bash
git tag -s v2.0.0 -m "Release v2.0.0"
git tag -v v2.0.0   # verify the signature
```

* `-s` creates a signed tag.
* `-v` verifies the signature and tells you if it matches a known key.

Signed tags are especially useful in open-source or enterprise projects where you need strong guarantees about who made a release.

üëâ One last note: tags don‚Äôt get pushed automatically. To share them, run:

```bash
git push origin v2.0.0      # push a single tag
git push origin --tags      # push all tags
```

### Seeing and Finding Tags

Tags pile up quickly in a project, so Git gives you ways to list, filter, and sort them.

#### List all tags

```bash
git tag
```

This just prints every tag name in your repo:

```
v1.0.0
v1.1.0
v2.0.0
v2.1.0-rc.1
```

#### Filter tags by pattern

```bash
git tag -l "v2.*"
```

Only tags starting with `v2.` show up:

```
v2.0.0
v2.1.0-rc.1
```

You can also match other patterns, like release candidates:

```bash
git tag -l "*-rc.*"
```

#### Show messages next to tags

Annotated tags can have messages, and `-n` lets you preview them:

```bash
git tag -n
```

Output:

```
v1.0.0   First stable release
v2.0.0   Usage-based billing, new invoices
```

You can also limit or filter:

```bash
git tag -n9 -l "v2.*"
```

This shows the first 9 lines of each tag message, but only for tags starting with `v2.`. Great when you want quick release notes.

#### Sort tags semantically

Normal sorting treats `v1.10.0` as *before* `v1.9.9` (because text sorting sees `1` vs `9`). Version-aware sort fixes that:

```bash
git tag --sort=-v:refname
```

Now the latest version appears first:

```
v2.1.0-rc.1
v2.0.0
v1.10.0
v1.9.9
```

#### Find the nearest tag to the current commit

```bash
git describe --tags
```

Example output:

```
v2.0.0-5-gdeadbeef
```

That means:

* the latest tag reachable is `v2.0.0`
* you‚Äôre 5 commits ahead of it
* the current commit starts with `deadbeef`

This is super useful in CI/CD pipelines for naming builds like `2.0.0+5`.


### Using Tags in Real Workflows

Tags are the backbone of releases, hotfixes, and rollbacks. Here are the most common ways you‚Äôll use them in practice.

#### Cutting a Release + Triggering CI

The usual flow:

1. Merge your release PR into `main`.
2. Create a tag at that commit.
3. Push the tag ‚Äî CI/CD kicks off.

Example:

```
A -- B -- C -- D -- E -- F  (main)
                ^           ^
               v1.1.0      v1.2.0   ‚Üê each tag starts a release build
```

Commands:

```bash
git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "v1.2.0: new billing"
git push origin v1.2.0
```

What happens next: most CI platforms (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI, etc.) can listen for ‚Äútag push‚Äù events. A tag like `v1.2.0` often triggers a pipeline that builds artifacts, signs them, and publishes a release.

#### Hotfix from a Release Tag

Say a bug slipped into production. You want to patch *exactly* what was shipped.

Instead of checking out the tag directly (which gives you a detached HEAD), make a branch starting from it:

```bash
git switch -c hotfix/invoice-rounding v1.2.0
```

Now you can fix, commit, and PR back into `main` or your release branch.

Interpretation: you‚Äôre working from the exact code you shipped last time ‚Äî no surprise commits from `main` sneaking in.

#### Rolling Back to a Known-Good Version

Sometimes the latest release misbehaves. Tags let you roll back safely.

See what commit a tag points to:

```bash
git show --no-patch v1.2.0
```

Deploy tooling (Heroku, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, etc.) often accepts a tag name directly:

```bash
deploy --ref v1.2.0
```

That redeploys the *exact same bytes* as last time. No guessing.

#### Generating a Changelog Between Releases

Need release notes or just want to see what changed? Compare two tags:

```bash
git log --oneline v1.1.0..v1.2.0
```

Shows commit subjects:

```
abc123  Fix invoice rounding error
def456  Add usage-based billing
```

Or see file-level stats:

```bash
git diff --stat v1.1.0..v1.2.0
```

Output:

```
billing.js    | 20 +++++++++++---------
invoice.test  | 12 ++++++++--
2 files changed, 22 insertions(+), 10 deletions(-)
```

Great for writing changelogs.

#### Checking Out a Tag (and Avoiding Detached HEAD Confusion)

To browse code at a tag:

```bash
git switch --detach v1.2.0
# or: git checkout v1.2.0
```

Now you‚Äôre in a detached HEAD state ‚Äî safe for read-only browsing, not great for new commits.

ASCII reminder:

```
(main) ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚óè‚îÄ‚îÄ‚óè‚îÄ‚îÄ‚óè‚îÄ‚îÄ‚óè
              ‚Üë
            v1.2.0  (HEAD is detached here)
```

If you do want to commit, make a branch first:

```bash
git switch -c fix-from-v1.2.0 v1.2.0
```

That way your work doesn‚Äôt get ‚Äúlost in limbo.‚Äù

### Moving, renaming, and deleting tags

#### Move a tag to a different commit (local)

```bash
git tag -f v2.0.0 NEWCOMMIT
```

If it‚Äôs already on the remote, you must **replace** it there too:

```bash
git push origin -f v2.0.0   # force updates tag ref on remote
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Caution:

* Force-moving public release tags can break consumers and automation. Prefer a **new tag** (e.g., `v2.0.1`) and deprecate the old.

#### Rename a tag (no direct rename; recreate)

```bash
git tag new-name old-name
git tag -d old-name
git push origin new-name
git push origin :refs/tags/old-name   # or: git push origin --delete old-name
```

#### Delete tags

Local:

```bash
git tag -d v2.0.0
```

Remote:

```bash
git push origin --delete v2.0.0
# or:
git push origin :refs/tags/v2.0.0
```

Interpretation:

* Deleting remote tags is sensitive. Communicate widely if it‚Äôs a release tag.

### Power viewing

See where tags sit in history:

```bash
git log --graph --decorate --oneline --all
```

You‚Äôll see tags in-line:

```
* 3fa1c2d (tag: v1.2.0, origin/main, main) Merge ...
* 0b7a3ff Add invoices API
* 9e0a1a1 (tag: v1.1.0) Release v1.1.0
```

Find tags with notes:

```bash
git tag -n | grep "billing"
```

Show only tags on the current branch:

```bash
git tag --merged
```

### Practical Naming for Tags

Pick a naming style that both humans and automation tools will love.

* Using *semantic versions* like `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` makes it clear what kind of change occurred, while skipping this practice leaves version meaning ambiguous; for example, `v2.0.1` signals a patch to version 2.0.
* Adding *pre-release* labels such as `-rc.1` or `-beta.2` lets pipelines handle them differently, while without them it is harder to separate testing builds from production releases; for example, `v2.1.0-rc.1` can be built but not shipped live.
* Choosing a *date-based* scheme like `release-2025-09-12` gives simple ordering for frequent releases, while omitting structure can make it unclear when versions were cut; for example, daily builds can be tagged by date.
* Protecting the *public namespace* for tags ensures only automated systems create official ones, while leaving it open risks personal tags being mistaken for releases; for example, locking down all `v*` tags prevents accidental production deployments.

Why bother with all this? Because automation thrives on predictable names ‚Äî and so do humans reading the history months later.

### Common ‚ÄúWhy Isn‚Äôt This Working?‚Äù Pitfalls

**‚ÄúI created the tag but CI didn‚Äôt run.‚Äù**

You probably forgot to push the tag. Remember:

```bash
git push origin v2.0.0
```

Also double-check your CI config ‚Äî many pipelines only listen for certain patterns (`v*`, `release-*`, etc.).

**‚ÄúI pushed but my teammate still can‚Äôt see it.‚Äù**

They need to fetch tags explicitly:

```bash
git fetch --tags
```

By default, `git fetch` doesn‚Äôt grab new tags unless they‚Äôre tied to commits being fetched.

**‚Äú`git show` doesn‚Äôt display my tag message.‚Äù**

That means you made a **lightweight tag**. Those don‚Äôt have messages. Use an annotated tag next time:

```bash
git tag -a v2.0.0 -m "Release v2.0.0"
```

**‚ÄúI checked out a tag and my commits disappeared.‚Äù**

That‚Äôs the classic **detached HEAD** trap. Tags don‚Äôt move, so commits made in this state get ‚Äúorphaned.‚Äù The fix: create a branch at the tag before committing:

```bash
git switch -c fix-from-v2.0.0 v2.0.0
```

**‚ÄúWe moved a release tag and broke everything.‚Äù**

Never rewrite or move public tags. Once something like `v2.0.0` is out in the world, it‚Äôs immutable. If you need to patch, bump the version (`v2.0.1`) instead.

### Real-world mini recipes (copy/paste)

Create an annotated release tag at HEAD and push:

```bash
git tag -a v2.3.0 -m "v2.3.0: SSO + revamped audit logs"
git push origin v2.3.0
```

Push only release tags automatically when pushing commits:

```bash
git push --follow-tags
```

Generate a changelog between releases:

```bash
git log v2.2.0..v2.3.0 --pretty=format:"- %s (%h)"
```

Diff code between releases:

```bash
git diff --stat v2.2.0..v2.3.0
```

Find latest version tag (nearest reachable):

```bash
git describe --tags --abbrev=0
```

Clean up a mistaken remote tag:

```bash
git tag -d v2.3.0
git push origin --delete v2.3.0
```

Retag correctly (same name, new commit), and push forcefully:

```bash
git tag -a -f v2.3.0 -m "v2.3.0: hotfix included" NEWCOMMIT
git push -f origin v2.3.0
```

(Again: **avoid** for public releases; prefer `v2.3.1`.)

### Why teams use tags in practice?

* A *tag* makes releases reproducible by serving as the single reference for what was shipped, while without tags it can be unclear which commit actually represents a release; for example, version 1.2.3 can always be rebuilt exactly as delivered.
* Using tags enables *CI/CD* systems to trigger builds and deployments consistently, but without them automation may behave unpredictably; for instance, a pipeline can sign and publish artifacts every time a new tag is pushed.
* Deploying by tag provides instant and precise *rollbacks*, while skipping tags forces guesswork about which commit is safe; for example, reverting to a ‚Äúv1.1‚Äù tag restores the prior release immediately.
* Generating changelogs and audits from tags gives easy diffs and logs between versions, while omitting tags makes history harder to track; for example, comparing ‚Äúv1.0‚Äù and ‚Äúv1.1‚Äù highlights all changes since the last release.
* Signed tags enhance *security* by proving provenance, while unsigned references cannot guarantee authenticity; for example, a GPG-signed ‚Äúv2.0‚Äù tag confirms it came from a trusted maintainer.
