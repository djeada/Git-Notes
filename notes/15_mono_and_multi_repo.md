## Monorepos

A monorepo is a single repository that contains all the code for a project, including multiple applications, libraries, and other dependencies. Monorepos are more suitable for large, monolithic projects where there is a need for close collaboration and frequent code reuse.

|                                       |
|             MONOREPO                  |
|                                       |
|  +-------+   +-------+   +-------+    |
|  | Proj1 |   | Proj2 |   | Proj3 |    |
|  +-------+   +-------+   +-------+    |
|                                       |
|  Shared Libraries & Dependencies      |
|                                       |
+---------------------------------------+
```

### Advantages

1. **Centralized Collaboration**: All code is in one place, promoting seamless cooperation and code reuse. Teams can easily collaborate on changes without having to juggle multiple repositories.
2. **Unified Dependency Management**: Changes to shared dependencies are made just once, eliminating the inconsistencies of managing them across several repositories.
3. **Facilitated Refactoring**: As the code is centralized, global changes or refactors can be executed more efficiently, with a clear understanding of potential side effects.
4. **Optimized Build and Test Times**: With everything in one location, build and test pipelines can be more efficiently organized, potentially leading to quicker integrations.

### Disadvantages

1. **Potential Git Slowdowns**: As the repository grows, Git operations (like cloning or fetching updates) may become slower, especially for developers without a fresh copy.
2. **Complexity of Branch Management**: Maintaining clarity among numerous branches can become challenging, increasing the risk of merge conflicts and integration issues.
3. **Tight Coupling Risk**: The ease of code sharing might inadvertently promote tight coupling between components or services that should remain loosely coupled.
4. **Steep Learning Curve**: New team members might find it daunting to navigate and understand a vast monorepo, potentially hampering their onboarding process.
5. **Advanced CI/CD Needed**: Given the extensive codebase, continuous integration and delivery tools might require more sophisticated configurations to handle the monorepo efficiently.
6. **Risks with Force Pushes**: An accidental force push or a corrupted master/main branch can have far-reaching implications, affecting every part of the project.

### When to Use

- **Large, Cohesive Projects**: A monorepo might be apt for expansive, monolithic projects that benefit from tight integration and collaboration.
- **Unified Team Structure**: Monorepos can be advantageous when a singular team or closely-knit teams manage the entirety of the code, ensuring consistent code quality and practices.

## Multirepos

A multirepo is a repository for each project, with each repository containing the code and dependencies for that project. Multirepos are more suitable for projects that are divided into multiple, independent components or services.

```
+-------+   +-------+   +-------+
|       |   |       |   |       |
| Repo1 |   | Repo2 |   | Repo3 |
|       |   |       |   |       |
| Proj1 |   | Proj2 |   | Proj3 |
|       |   |       |   |       |
+-------+   +-------+   +-------+

+--------------------------------------+
|   Shared Libraries & Dependencies    |
+--------------------------------------+
```

### Advantages

1. **Clear Versioning**: Each service or component can be versioned independently, allowing for detailed tracking of changes and easier dependency management.
2. **Enhanced Git Performance**: Individual code checkouts and pulls remain lean, ensuring swift Git operations regardless of the overall project size.
3. **Facilitated Team Autonomy**: Teams can focus on their specific components without the need to navigate or understand the entire codebase, leading to potential productivity boosts.
4. **Increased Flexibility**: With autonomy comes the freedom for teams to make decisions tailored to their component, potentially resulting in innovative solutions and faster development cycles.

### Disadvantages

1. **Dependency Coordination**: It becomes crucial to harmonize dependencies and libraries used across distinct services or components, which can be challenging.
2. **Risk of Siloed Development**: Separate repositories can sometimes lead to teams working too independently, potentially leading to code redundancies and a reduction in cross-team collaboration.
3. **Code Reuse Challenges**: Sharing common code or utilities across different repositories often requires added effort, potentially slowing down the development process.
4. **Complex Deployment Orchestration**: Deploying interconnected services from different repositories demands more sophisticated coordination, possibly complicating release processes.

### When to Use

- **Modular Projects**: Multirepo setups thrive in projects segmented into multiple, independent components or services that might evolve at their own pace.
- **Diverse Team Structures**: Projects with multiple teams, each focusing on different aspects or components, might benefit from a multirepo approach. This is especially true when different parts of a project demand their own deployment cycles.
