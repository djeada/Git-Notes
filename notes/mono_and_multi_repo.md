## Monorepos

A monorepo is a single repository that contains all the code for a project, including multiple applications, libraries, and other dependencies. Monorepos are more suitable for large, monolithic projects where there is a need for close collaboration and frequent code reuse.

### Advantages

* Simplifies cooperation and code reuse: Because everyone is using the same repository, it is much easier to share code and collaborate on changes.
* Simplifies dependency management: Changes to dependencies only need to be made once, rather than in multiple repositories.
* Facilitates refactoring: It is easier to make changes across the entire codebase, rather than in separate repositories.
* May improve build and test times: All code is stored in the same place, so it is faster to build and test changes.

### Disadvantages

* May slow down Git operations: As the codebase grows in size, Git may become slower to perform operations such as cloning or pulling.
* May be difficult to manage feature branches: With a large number of branches, it may be harder to keep track of all the changes and ensure that they are properly merged.
* Encourages tight coupling: It is easy to import code from within the same codebase
* May be difficult for new team members to understand: A large codebase can be overwhelming for new team members, making it harder for them to get up to speed and contribute effectively.
* May require a more complex CI/CD setup: Because the entire codebase is built and tested together, the CI/CD system may need to be more sophisticated and capable of handling a large amount of code.
* A force push to the master branch could cause widespread problems: If the master branch becomes broken, it could affect the entire project and team, rather than just a small subset of code.

### When to use

* Suitable for large, monolithic projects with a need for close collaboration and frequent code reuse
* May work well when there is a single team responsible for all the code in the project

## Multirepos

A multirepo is a repository for each project, with each repository containing the code and dependencies for that project. Multirepos are more suitable for projects that are divided into multiple, independent components or services.

### Advantages

* Simplifies versioning: Each service or library has its own versioning, making it easier to track changes and manage dependencies.
* Improves Git performance: Code checkouts and pulls are smaller and separate, so there are no performance issues even as the project grows in size.
* Facilitates independent work: Teams can work independently and do not need access to the entire codebase.
* Improves flexibility: Each team has more freedom and control over their own codebase, allowing for faster development.

### Disadvantages

* Requires coordination of dependencies: The dependencies and libraries used across services and projects must be synchronized on a regular basis.
* Encourages a siloed culture: With separate repositories, there may be a tendency for teams to work in isolation, resulting in duplicate code and a lack of collaboration.
* May be more difficult to share code: Reusing code across repositories requires more effort and coordination.
* May require more complex deployment processes: With multiple repositories, it may be more difficult to coordinate the deployment of changes across all the different components.

### When to use

* Suitable for projects that are divided into multiple, independent components or services
* May work well when there are multiple teams working on different parts of the project, or when there is a need for independent deployment of different components
